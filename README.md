# CamIO with LLM integration

## Environment setup:

This version of CamIO runs with Python 3.8. Once installed, the required packages can be set up with the following commands.</br>
If you are on an Apple Silicon machine, please follow the [Apple Silicon-specific instructions](#for-apple-silicon-machines) before running these commands.

```bash
# Required for the PyAudio library
brew install portaudio

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python3.8 -m venv camio-llm    # or python3, depending on your setup
cd camio-llm
source bin/activate

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Coughlan-Lab/simple_camio.git
mv simple_camio src
cd src
git switch llm

# Install Python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp example.env .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to set the correct values for the environment variables.

### Environment variables:

The following environment variables must be set in the `.env` file:

-   `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for the OpenAI LLM model, can be obtained [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
-   `GOOGLE_SPEECH_CLOUD_KEY_FILE`: path to the Google Cloud service account key file, follow this guide to create one.
-   `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`: API key for the Google Routes API, follow this guide to create one.

### Google Cloud project setup:

For the speech-to-text and the routing systems to work, a Google Cloud project must be set up with the following APIs enabled:

-   Speech-to-text API
-   Routes API

To create a Google Cloud project and enable the required APIs, follow this steps:

1. Access this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome) and create a new project.
2. Set the new project as active by selecting it from the project dropdown menu in the top left corner
3. In the search bar at the top of the page, search for "Cloud Speech-to-Text API" and enable it.
4. Do the same for the "Routes API".
5. In the search bar, search for "Credentials".
6. Click on "Create credentials" and select "API key". This will generate a new API key that you can use as the `GOOGLE_ROUTES_API_KEY`.
7. Click on "Create credentials" again and select "Service account key". Create a new service account with the role "Owner". Click on the newly created service account and in the "Keys" tab, click on "Add key" and select "JSON". This will download a JSON file that you can use as the `GOOGLE_SPEECH_CLOUD_KEY_FILE`.

### For Apple Silicon machines:

On Apple Silicon machines, the PyAudio library may not work natively and will throw an exception when imported. Therefore, itâ€™s necessary to use the Intel version of Python.</br>
Here's how to set it up:

1. Verify if Rosetta is installed:

```bash
pkgutil --pkg-info com.apple.pkg.RosettaUpdateAuto
```

2. If Rosetta is not installed, run the following command to install it:

```bash
softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```

3. Enable Rosetta for your terminal:
   Go to Finder > Applications, make a copy of your preferred terminal (e.g., Terminal or iTerm), rename the copy, then right-click and select "Get Info". Check the box for "Open using Rosetta". Use this new terminal to run the following commands.

4. Install the Intel version of Homebrew:

```bash
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

(echo; echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/<YOUR USERNAME>/.zprofile
eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

5. Create an alias for Intel Homebrew:

```bash
echo 'alias ibrew="/usr/local/bin/brew"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

6. Install the Intel version of Python 3.8:

```bash
ibrew install python@3.8
```

7. Create an alias for Intel Python 3.8:

```bash
echo 'alias ipython3.8="/usr/local/bin/python3.8"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, proceed with the general setup instructions from [Environment Setup](#environment-setup), replacing `python3.8` with `ipython3.8` and `brew` with `ibrew`.
Additionally, once the virtual environment is activated and you are in the `src` folder, you might need to run the following command:
```bash
alias ipython3.8="../bin/python"
```

## Running the code:

To run the code, simply run the following command:

```bash
python3.8 camio.py --model <path_to_model>
```
Replace python3.8 with ipython3.8 if you're on an Apple Silicon Machine.

Root privileges may be required to run the code.

For a list of all available command line arguments, run:

```bash
python3.8 camio.py --help
```

## Keyboard shortcuts:

-   `q`: Quit the application
-   `Space`: Start/Stop LLM question recording
-   `Enter`: Stop TTS
-   `Escape`: Pause/Resume TTS
-   `n`: Disable navigation mode
-   `d`: Play map description
