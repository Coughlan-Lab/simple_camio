DISK_THING_SPARSE_081,Magic Bridge Object Names/Disk Spinner.mp3,,"The disk spinner may seem like a basic spinner, but of all the spinners at Magical Bridge it can offer the most thrilling and challenging spinning experience. The disk spinner almost looks like an enormous thumbtack that isn’t put in the ground perfectly straight. The disk is around 5 feet in diameter. On one side it is 1 foot off the ground and on the highest side it is 3 feet off the ground. So not only will you rotate when you are on the disk spinner, but you will go up and down. Users can sit or lay on the disk, or for a more challenging adventure, stand on the disk and rotate it by walking. The disk spinner is 12 inches high on one side, which is a bit high to transfer from a wheelchair so it would be good to have some assistance to do it. Even those who can’t move much or at all could be lifted and placed on the disk spinner for an enjoyable spin ride.",

Though the motion sensors are high overhead and out of reach, they can see you and detect your movements if you are standing directly under the arch. Much like plucking the string of a harp, passing through the beams triggers custom circuitry and sensors to produce musical notes. Users play to create an ambiance that is individual to the moment of interaction that reflects the broad idea of play that’s still fun and sophisticated. When crowds flock to it and people start to play independently, the group is participating in a musical symphony. For more information on this remarkable and innovative installation, please visit CODA Works, where the Magical Harp won a 2016 CODA Award.",

SPINNING_CONE_SPARSE_076,Magic Bridge Object Names/Net Spinner.mp3,,The Net Spinner is a combined climbing experience and a spinning experience. The structure of the Net Spinner is a large cone shaped net. The net is anchored at the bottom to a large horizontal disk about 8 feet in diameter and about 1 foot from the ground. Coming up from the center of the disk is pole that is 12 feet. A network of ropes is attached from the top of the pole to the outside edge of the disks to form a net that can be climbed on. A person standing next to the net spinner can push on the ropes in a circular direction causing the entire net spinner to rotate. Many people can climb on the net or sit safely on the disk inside at once. Not only is the net spinner a climbing challenge but you will get some good stimulus to your balance (vestibular) system if someone rotates the net spinning while you are at the top. Keep in mind the whole thing can spin as you are at a height of 8 or more feet off the ground. How do you know if you are ready to climb to the top of the net spinner? People should be comfortable with climbing short distances up and down the net before going to the top.,

So best if you are visually impaired to ask folks to stop the carousel before approaching it. The carousel has two benches for up to 3 people each to sit on while riding the carousel and also has two magical parking spaces for wheelchairs. To transfer a wheelchair onto the ground carousel simply lift the safety rail, roll into the space provided and park the wheelchair. Set the safety break on the wheelchair, then bring the safety rail down. If you have the arm strength to do it, you can “turn” the disk in the middle of the spinner which will cause the whole carousel to rotate.",
